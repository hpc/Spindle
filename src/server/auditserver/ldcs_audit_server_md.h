/**
 * This functions are the API for Spindle's network communication.  They assume
 * all communication will flow in some tree-like form.  Requests for information
 * flow up the tree towards the root, while information flows down the tree towards
 * the roots.   This information is usually requests and contents for  files and 
 * directory listings.
 *
 * There could be multiple implementations of this layer, depending on how Spindle
 * is configured.  As of the writing of this comment, there is a COBO based 
 * implementation in ldcs_audit_server_md_cobo.c
 *
 * This layer receives messages via a registered callback.  The 
 * ldcs_audit_server_md_register_fd associates a callback function with a file
 * descriptor.  This callback will be triggered whenever the fd has data
 * available.  That callback should read the data off the network, put it into
 * a ldcs_message_t* and then call handle_server_message on the packet.
 *
 * Messages are sent from this interface through a set of functions in the 
 * below API, which are called by the handlers.
 * 
 *  * = The zero-copy mechanism requires special handling when reading a 
 *      LDCS_MSG_FILE_DATA type.  In those cases just read the header. 
 *      Do not read the file contents off the network.  Leave it there, and 
 *      ldcs_audit_server_md_complete_msg_read will later be used to read 
 *      the packet payload.
