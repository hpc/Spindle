/**
 * sheep stands for "shared heap".  It's a malloc/free system that's safe to use
 * in memory shared between processes.  It's up to higher-level code to make to
 * serialize access to the heap.  sheep's main responsibility is making sure that
 * the internal pointers in the heap are position independent (and thus the heap
 * can be mapped at different locations in different processes).
 *
 * It's also up to the user to ensure that any pointers they store in the shared heap:
 *  - only point at other things in the shared heap
 *  - are also position-independent pointers.
 *
 * To help with the position-independent pointers use the sheep_ptr_t for any pointer
 * stored in the shared heap.  Store a regular pointer into a sheep_ptr_t using set_sheep_ptr(),
 * and retrieve a regular pointer back out using sheep_ptr().
